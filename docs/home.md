## Application

### Main page

The main page of the application provides an overview of the ISMS and the checks to be carried out.

It is composed of:

* on the left, the application's main menu;
     * at the top of the indicators on:
         * the number of security domains
         * the number of selected controls
         * the number of measures carried out
         * the number of action plans

Note: 
* if a domain has no controls, or none of the domain's controls are planned, then the domain is not taken into account.
* if a control is not planned, it is not included in the count.
* if an action plan has been completed, it is not taken into account.

* between :
     * The inspection schedule which shows the inspections to be carried out with their result (green, orange or red) and the planned inspections (in grey)
     * An overall state of controls
